[Verse 1]
When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather in a beautiful world
I wish I was special, you're so fuckin' special
[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice when I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special, I wish I was special
[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Bridge]
She's runnin' out the door
She's runnin' out
She run, run, run, run
Run [Outro]
Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special, I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
[Bridge]
She's runnin' out the door
She's runnin' out
She run, run, run, run
Run
[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special, I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
